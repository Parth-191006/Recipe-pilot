# Recipe Pilot

**Plan it. Shop it. Cook it.** — an offline-first recipe library that turns any
recipe into a tidy, aisle-by-aisle grocery list in one tap.

> ### 🏷 One app, two names
>
> The app is **Recipe Pilot**: that is what the launcher, the splash screen and
> every release asset say. This repository is called **`Pantry-pilot`** — the
> project's original codename, and still the slug in every link below. There is
> no second, renamed copy to go hunting for; the Dart package id is
> `pantry_pilot` too, which is why upgrades install in place instead of
> duplicating themselves.

## 📲 Install on your phone

> **No Flutter, no Android Studio, no building.** Every push to `main` produces
> a ready-to-install APK and attaches it to a permanent release.

1. **[Download the latest APK →](https://github.com/Parth-191006/Pantry-pilot/releases/latest)**
   (<https://github.com/Parth-191006/Pantry-pilot/releases/latest>)

   The release carries one file per CPU architecture — pick
   **`Recipe-Pilot-v*-arm64-v8a.apk`** unless you know your phone is different.
   That is every mainstream device made since roughly 2015, and it is roughly a
   third the size of the old all-in-one download (~16 MB vs ~49 MB):

   | File | Pick it when |
   |---|---|
   | `…-arm64-v8a.apk` | Any modern phone or tablet — **the default** |
   | `…-armeabi-v7a.apk` | An older 32-bit device |
   | `…-x86_64.apk` | Emulators and Intel-based tablets |
2. Copy it to your phone (or just open the link on your phone) and tap it.
3. Android will ask to allow installs from your browser — allow it once.
4. **If Play Protect shows a "scanning" or "unknown app" prompt:** tap
   **More details → Install anyway**. That warning appears for *any* app
   installed outside the Play Store; Recipe Pilot is open-source, has
   **no ads, no tracking, and never touches the network**, so there is
   nothing for it to scan for.
5. That's it. Updates install over the old version and keep all your recipes.

## ✨ What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| 📖 **Library** | 10 built-in recipes across Italian, Mexican, Asian and Mediterranean cuisines — plus unlimited recipes of your own. Recipes you add get their **own shelf** at the top of the home screen, newest first, with the built-in catalogue shelved below them. |
| 🧠 **Offline parser** | Type or paste `2 cups spinach, chopped` and the rule-based parser extracts amount, unit and name, merges synonyms (*green onions → Scallions*), and files it under 🥬 **Produce**. Quantities that measure the same thing add up across units too — `200 g` in one place plus `1 kg` in another becomes one **1.2 kg** row, not two. |
| 🛒 **Smart list** | One tap converts any recipe into categorized aisle sections — Produce, Dairy & Eggs, Pantry, Spices… — with a live progress meter. Lines too messy to split safely ("2 cups flour and 1 cup sugar") land in a **Needs review** bucket, and every one of them is a **two-tap fix**: rewrite the line (split it by adding a line break) and it goes through the same parser into its real aisle, or drop it. |
| ✅ **Tactile check-off** | Checkboxes pop with a confetti micro-burst, rows dim and strike through, and finishing the list triggers a full celebration. |
| ➕ **Add-recipe studio** | Auto-suggested emoji, paste-a-block → split into rows, and a *live aisle preview* that runs the real parser as you type. |
| ⏱ **Cook-along mode** | One step at a time in huge kitchen-readable text, with a per-step countdown ring (start / pause / resume), a stopwatch for untimed steps, and screen keep-awake so nothing sleeps mid-simmer. Add steps like “Simmer the sauce, 10 min” and the timer builds itself — then **adjust it as you cook** (+1 min, +5 min, −1 min, or hand the step back to the stopwatch), and give an untimed step a timer of your own. Your adjustments belong to that step and that cook; the saved recipe is never rewritten behind your back. |
| 🌙 **Night kitchen** | Hand-tuned dark mode with soft glowing icons (toggleable), a cartoon kitchen hero that switches to a night scene, and aurora-lighted splash. |
| 🔒 **Private by design** | Everything lives in Hive boxes on your device. Zero network calls, zero analytics, zero ads. |

stagger-cascades into place; filter pills replay the cascade for the new set.

```

**One logo, three surfaces.** `lib/ui/logo.dart` draws the mark — a single
minimalist leaf — as vector paths (app bar, splash, About, empty states).
`tool/generate_icons.py` renders the same geometry to the launcher PNGs with
plain `zlib` + `struct`, so the home-screen icon and the in-app logo can never
drift apart.

**One parser, three callers.** The studio preview, the recipe → list
conversion and the review-row editor all call the same [IngredientParser] —
fixing a flagged line by hand runs the exact rules a pasted ingredient would,
which is why the fix lands in the right aisle instead of an "Other" bucket.

## 🏗 Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parth-191006/Pantry-pilot.git
cd Pantry-pilot
flutter create . --platforms android   # one-time: generates android/
flutter pub get
python tool/generate_icons.py          # regenerate launcher art after logo edits
python tool/patch_gradle_signing.py    # wire release signing (generated folder)
dart run flutter_launcher_icons        # write launcher icons
flutter run                            # device/emulator
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi   # one APK per ABI, ~16 MB each
flutter build apk --release             # ...or one universal APK (~49 MB)
flutter test                           # logic + golden corpus + widget tests
```

CI runs the same three commands (`flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, then
`flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi`) on every push to `main`, so the
release assets and the test suite are always built from the same commit.

### 🧪 Tests

`test/ingredient_parser_test.dart` covers the audited parser patterns;
`test/golden/ingredient_corpus.txt` is a **checked-in corpus of ~120 real
recipe lines** (each annotated with the outcome it must produce) replayed by
`test/ingredient_corpus_test.dart`, so a rule tweak that quietly breaks a line
someone actually cooks from fails the build. Widget tests cover the grocery
list, the review-row editor, the separate user-recipe shelf and the cook-along
timers.

## 🧠 Offline-first design

- **Storage:** Hive boxes (`recipes`, `grocery_list`, `settings`) hold plain
  maps — no codegen, no TypeAdapters. `GroceryStore` is the *only* file that
  touches Hive; swapping to MMKV or sqlite3 means rewriting one class.
- **State:** one `AppController extends ChangeNotifier` exposes recipes, the
  generated list, filters and checked-state as data; screens subscribe via
  `InheritedNotifier` (`context.app`). Persistence writes are fire-and-forget so
  toggling a checkbox never awaits disk.
- **Parsing:** 100% rule-based, deterministic, and synchronous — identical input
  always yields identical sections, which keeps entrance animations stable
  across restarts.
- **Cook-along timers:** wall-clock deadlines driven by a single 1 Hz ticker —
  pausing can't accumulate drift, and the screen is held awake with
  `wakelock_plus` (one platform-channel flag, no permissions).
- **Imagery:** the hero is a `CustomPainter` cartoon scene and the logo is
  vector paths — the APK ships **zero image assets**, and the app makes **zero
  network calls**.
- **Survives everything:** checked state persists on every toggle; seeds merge
  on every launch so new built-ins appear for existing installs without
  touching your recipes.

## ✨ Animation hookup guide

Every animation lives in `lib/ui/animations.dart` and is a plain widget you can
drop into any screen — nothing is coupled to this app's state layer. Several are
Flutter ports of [React Bits](https://reactbits.dev) components.

| Want… | Use | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Screen transition | `sharedAxisRoute(page: ...)` | Push with `Navigator.push(context, sharedAxisRoute(...))`. 340 ms shared-axis slide+fade+scale. |
| Tactile checkbox | `StrikeCheckbox(checked, onChanged)` | One controller orchestrates fill → checkmark sweep → pop → confetti micro-burst. Restores settled state when loaded from storage. |
| Checked-row dimming | `CheckedItemAnimator(checked, child)` | AnimatedContainer tint + 55% opacity dim, driven only when `checked` flips. |
| Strikethrough | `AnimatedStrikeText(checked, text)` | `AnimatedDefaultTextStyle` cross-fades the line through the text. |
| Shopping progress | `ProgressRing`, `LinearProgressMeter` | Implicit tweens; the meter glides to every new fraction (the CSS-style width transition). |
| Entrance cascade | `StaggeredEntrance(index: i, child: ...)` | 60 ms cascade slide+fade, cancellable timer (safe under dispose). |
| Completion moment | `SectionConfetti(playing: ...)` | Full-screen particle rain, fires once when the last item is checked. |
| Shiny text *(React Bits)* | `ShinyText(text: ...)` | Masked gradient sweeps across the glyphs on a loop. |
| Rolling numbers *(React Bits)* | `CountUp(value: ...)` | Implicitly animates from 0 (or the previous value) with no timers. |
| Running border beam *(React Bits)* | `BorderBeam(child: ...)` | Rotating sweep-gradient stroke + blurred halo around any child. |
| Aurora backdrop *(React Bits)* | `AuroraBackdrop(intensity: ...)` | Blurred colour field drifting behind the splash / empty states. |
| Press feedback | `PressableScale(onTap: ..., child: ...)` | Springy scale-down on touch, with cursor + semantics for desktop and screen readers. |

To wire a new animated element: build it as a `StatefulWidget` with a single
`AnimationController`, expose inputs as plain constructor params (`checked`,
`progress`, `index`), drive via `didUpdateWidget`, and wrap in
`RepaintBoundary` so off-screen rows don't repaint. That's the entire pattern
used in this codebase.

## ⚡ Performance notes

- One `AnimationController` per micro-interaction (no ticker stew); each
  animated row is a `RepaintBoundary`, and the looping decorations (steam,
  shiny text, border beam, aurora) are painter work inside their own boundaries.
- The heaviest thing here is a `CustomPainter` drawing ~70 circles for 1.6 s of
  confetti.
- Widget tests never call `pumpAndSettle` — the looping animations would not
  settle — so they pump explicit durations and flush stagger timers instead
  (see `test/helpers.dart`).
